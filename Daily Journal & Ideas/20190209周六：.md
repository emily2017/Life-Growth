Shedding the weight Day 19 - Living life with love

All creation comes from love.We make living far more difficult than it needs to be. 

The purpose about transformation is to feel good about your life. 

Love is the essence of true self. When you don't take things too personally, it's much easier to forgive.

We are all conditioned to cling to our personal  point of view. 

Nothing is personal when you meditate. The only thing that counts is pure experience in the now.

I find myself in a world created by love.
