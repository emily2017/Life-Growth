# 20180525  吵架后第一天

20180525  周五   天气：晴天
昨天跟Nancy做了吵架后第一次Life Coach。Nancy的一直要求我接受小新的道歉，并让我向他道歉。并没有把整件事情梳理清楚，这让我觉得很茫然。
很多东西在脑子里梳理不清楚。
整个辅导拖了很长时间，他们始终没有说服我，第一次没有确切的结论就散了。
我需要花时间，好好想一想。

下一次life coach想要提出的内容：
The communication is not the problem, the real problem is his resrntment towards me.
Is how he sees me.
I've been away from his bussiness for one month, and problem seemed resolved.
But this time, I just shared an opinion, and he got angry.
So if it's just about me changing my way of talking, it's just cut the chance for his angry, it's just an illusion of peace.
It's not that I was suggestive, and that hurt him, and he blew up.
It's his resentment that turned every sentence I said into sth. mean.
Where does his resentment come from?
Is it because I hurt him?
If felt hurt, he should be sad, and shed tears at that moment, why angry?
What does that angry come from?
I don't understand.
I just shared some ideas, and he got angry at me.Why is that?
Why he said he have resentment towards me because he can't be the real him in front of me? And that Because of me, he can't do what he wants to do?
And that he never know what to talk about and how to talk about everything in fromnt of mebecause I always deny him?
Is it true?
How do you communicate?
Don't you speak your different ideas when heard sth?
Isn't it normal that you have some information to add when someone talk to you about sth,why it becomes denying when I do this? Why it become the reason for him not talking to me and never respond to my topics?
Does he do this and have the same feeling towards everyone else?
I don't think so.
All the problems maybe began with my way of talking at the very first.
But I've been changing all the time.I tried hard to let go of my intention to change him.
And I really don't want to change him any more, I now accept who he is and believe the importance of being indepenent.
I'm trying my best to support,and encourage him.
But the problem never disappeared.And it's getting worse.
I made the change,but why it's getting worse?
I can sense the resentment in his heart towards me.
It's getting stronger and stronger, evertime I apologize, I admit that I did sth inappropriate, it made him more confident about hating me is the right thing.
Everytime, he would get angry at me as long as he feels, he thinks I'm hurting him, while I had no thoughts near that.
He become the victim.
He's always waiting for me to apologize.
For him, it's just that he didn't control himself at that second,he will not do it again.
And for me, it's like always.
I'm always denying him.
I'm always qustioning him.
I'm always hurting him.
Even though I told him that I'm not.
He still insist that I am questioning him.
So everytime when we begin to fight, he behaved so cold.
Even I cried like a baby,he would just ask why I cry like treating a enemy.
At that moment, he feels that he's the right one, I did all the bad thing, I don't have any reason to be sad.
But I did nothing.
I just did what I am.
He never told me that he's hurt when things happened.
He just hide his feelings, and cultivate resentment towards me secretly as time goes by.
When we were fighting on January, he showed strong hatred towards me.
He admitted that he really hate me since long time ago.
That's why I was so desperate.
Because he never told me about that.
He made me feel that everything is OK. But cultivated hatred towards me everytime he felt hurt.
I thought what he showed is the real him.
So I treated him the way I thought is right,because he never told me that's not right.
It's all in his control.
He made me feel it's OK to treat him the way I know, then when things go wrong, he turn into a relentless stranger, think that I deserve all the hurt and I have no reason to feel sad.
He always consider himself the victim in our relationship.
So he's always right.
But is it true?
Why I feel that I'm the victim?
I became the bad person without even knowing anything.
Why I feel it's like a trap for me?
I just behave myself, no one said anything, and suddenly, I'm the bad guy.
I  don't understand.
Why he doesn't tell is OK.
How can I know which part of my behavior is not appropriate if he's not saying anything? If he's just hiding everything?
And it's been 4years, how much resentment is there in his heart?
And is it still my responsibility to solve the problem?
Is everything going to be alright if he's with great resentment towards me all the way up?
Isn't he going to get angry any time he decide that I am hurting him?
He might think I am too loud even I speak really gentlly.
He might think I am questioning him when I just ask questions , when I just curious, just want to know more about him.
He might think i'm pushing him into accept sth even if i just share a information and want some responce.
Saturday bus
I was curious, i asked question,he got angry immediately and don't respond to my question.
A lot of times, i just shared information, ask him for his ideas,he immediately got angry because he decided that I am questioning him or pushing him to accept things.
It's not about how I said it, it's about how he sees it ,how he heard it, it's about how he sees me,how he sees my intension.
When he told me that he was hiding, i smiled with sadness and desperate.he immediately asked:"You are laughing at me .isn't it?You are looking down upon me, aren't you?"
Do you dare to say no?
I felt so 无奈，委屈。
Everytime when he react emotionally towards me, there should me same voice in his mind.
You are questioning me again!
You are pushing me again!
You are being loud again!
You are denying me again!
……
While i was just being curious,
Sharing sth i learned with him and ask for some response
Was just too excited and getting loud alittle.
Saying that I have different ideas with him.
Why our relationship didn't change.
It's because the only one who is working on it is me.
He consider him the victim of our relationship, so he thinks that everything is going to be OK as long as I change.
So even though he began life coach because our relationship was stuck, but he never deal with anything about relationship on his individual session.
He is never working on the relationship.
Actually he never thought he has any problems on relationship
He would never consider working on it since he think he doesn't need to . It's all other's fault. What he need is just doing nothing on it and feels good about it.
If he thinks he has no problem on it. How he describe the thing is all about others being wrong .and he being victim.
He never tried to understand me. I'm always trying to understand him and change my  behavior.
But he never tried to understand me.he doesn't eant to.
He just judge me without hesitatipn.
He belive what he think is me.
He's a good pretender
He knows exactly how to behave abd talk in a gesture of victim.
He will never show the real him until you iratate him.
But it's not easy to do that.
Since he is a good guy to everyone.
He's not going to be angry at anyone else.
Except me.
He's giving all his angry towards me.
 I know it's a way of letting out the emotion .
But he's angry at me without knowing the reason, and he icture me as some bad and mean one.
That is not fair.
I don't deserve that.
Has he been angry at any one else except me and his father?
Sure not.
He is always angry at himself .
But now he has someone to hate.
To pour his angry at.

真正的问题不是沟通问题，不是我用什么样的方式跟他说话，而是他怎么看我，是他心里对我莫名的怨恨。
每次life coach我同意合作，就更让他觉得，自己对我的怨恨理所当然。
对于沟通这个问题，我们之前就已经聊过；对于stay in your business,上次也聊过。同样的事情，在session的时候都做过，但根本无济于事。
昨天在做的时候，我觉得特别无意义，因为知道都是假的，都是暂时的，问题根本没有解决。
他流着泪说对不起，然后说自己真的抱歉，同样的场景，一个月前一模一样。
可是为什么，一个月后的今天，状况又回到了老样子？
这一个月里，我大部分的时间和精力放在自己的事情上，不再过问他的事情，对他的事情，不做过多评价。
可结果是，我们俩之间的话越来越少，我不知道他每天在干什么，想什么。他什么都不跟我说，我问了，也只是简单的一两句话完事。问多了，就变成我在质问他，就开始生气。
在他告诉我芝加哥不去了的时候，我问为什么，他只说突然觉得不是真的想去，所以不去了。我再问，依旧是同样的答案。再也没话。我不知道他做这个决定前因后果到底是什么。是不是一时冲动。
于是我只能自言自语，结果，就把他惹毛了，觉得我在干涉他自由。
我告诉他，我只是说出我的意见，没有任何干涉他的意思，那是他的事，他自己决定就好。
然后，第二天，一整天的时间，没话。
什么都不说。问什么答什么，不问就不说话。问多了就烦。
我忍不了了，问他是不是对我有情绪，他说没有。说只是昨天晚上有。
我问那为什么对我爱理不理，对跟我说话一点都不感兴趣的样子？是不是很不想跟我说话？是不是根本懒得理我？
他急了，说心里对我有怨气。
说觉得在我面前不能做他想做的事。
说我不让他喝茶，不让他喝咖啡，不让他一边听歌一边干活。
说面对我不知道说什么，说什么都是错的。
我一下子觉得莫名其妙。
什么叫我不让你做你想做的事，你想做就做啊，我拿刀逼你了吗？
你想喝茶你就喝啊，我不让你喝你就不喝了吗？
他说我在喝，我每天都在喝，只是不在你面前喝。脸上带着报复的快感。
我突然就明白了。
我说过的话，他不管愿不愿意，自己全都照做，然后回过头来，把心里不痛快的责任全部推给我。
他想喝茶，想喝咖啡，但是我说了，喝多了不好，不要喝，于是他就不喝。但不喝心里不痛快，于是就开始埋怨我，凭什么不让他喝。
然后开始用报复的心态，偷偷摸摸喝，等着有一天用这种报复的心态看我如何败下阵来。
四年多了，我不知道有多少这样的事情，也不知道在这些事情中，他积累了多少对我的怨恨，在我完全不知情的情况下。
所以他总是莫名其妙就对我有情绪。
我做什么说什么都能戳到他神经的痛点。
所以他跟我说话，从来没有正常的沟通模式，从来都是对抗。
只要我给他的回应不是正面的，立马擦枪走火，就开始跟我对抗。
所以我总是觉得他好像听不懂我说话，他好像听不进去我说什么。
因为他从来没有用心去听过我说什么，他永远带着情绪。
从一个月前看似无比和谐到现在，不是因为我总是在干涉他，不是因为我们沟通方式不对。而是因为他内心对我的怨恨，一直都在。
所以哪怕一个月相安无事，只一件小小的事，一个正常的观点分享，就又激起他的无名怒火。
所以无论如何，他在我面前始终没有话说，他不让我知道他在干什么，他在想什么，用他的话来说，在我面前什么都不做，什么都不说才是最安全的。
可能我说话的方式确实让他感觉到受伤。
可能每个人都不喜欢别人的建议。
但这是我们矛盾的原因吗？
受伤是他愤怒的原因吗？
受伤是他在我面前隐藏，什么都不说，欺骗我的原因吗？
如果说是因为我说话的方式让他受伤然后愤怒，那么换别人，他会有同样的表现吗？
他确实没想过伤害我，但他知道自己在骗我吗？他知道他一直在用虚假的一面面对我吗？
这一切都是因为我伤害了他？？？
他说只有在我suggestive的时候对我有情绪。是吗？那我每天每时每刻都在suggestive吗？为什么他一直在用虚假的一面面对我，为什么说在我面前不知道说什么，什么都不敢说？
是因为我说话的方式伤害他了吗？
还是他从心里对我有恶意的揣测？
为什呢兜兜转转这么久，问题一点都没解决，反而越来越大？？？
难道是因为我一直在干涉他，一直在给他伤害吗？
还是他心里一直怀着对我的怨恨，对我的恶意揣测，一直在用欺骗的方式隐瞒事实，等着有一天看我笑话，证明一切都是我的错？
他一直在等我认错，等我承认一切都是我造成的，他只是个受害者。这样他就可以心安理得地做一切我无法接受的事，同时不失去这段关系。
他要把我变成一个坏人，以此来保护自己。
如果真的只是沟通的问题，为什么已经改变了沟通方式，问题还是在？
为什么改变了沟通方式以后获得的和谐，只是短暂的虚假和平？
之前达到和谐的时候就总觉得哪里不对。
虽然不吵架，不对抗了，但是总觉得少了什么东西。两个人得连接好像也少了。
没有吵架争执的背后，是连基本得连接也不见了。两个人每天只是形式性地在一起。感觉不到任何连接。
我不知道他每天在干什么，想什么，心情如何，不知道他对什么事情有什么态度，什么想法。
我面对的好像是个没有生命的个体。
没有争执其实是因为没有连接了。
只要想恢复连接，问题就依然在那。
过去一个月，什么都没解决，什么都没改变。
之所以看起来和谐了，是因为我们退回了各自的角落，不再有相互的触碰。
问题被回避了而已。
所以，根本不是说话方式的问题。
我改了说话方式，但他心中的怨恨还在，一切还是老样子。
关键不是我怎么说，只要他看我的方式不变，我怎么说，在他听来都是故意伤害。
我可以放下过去重新开始。
但是他能放下四年来积累的对我的莫名怨恨吗？
而他的怨恨来自哪里呢？
是我做错了什么嘛？
是他自己做了选择，然后不愿意承担选择的后果，于是我变成了那个让他难受的人。
于是我开始被怨恨。
每一次他做了自己不想做的选择，都把那笔账算在我头上。
他在我面前开开心心地答应不喝茶，不喝咖啡，听我想听的歌，看我想看的电视剧，跟我一起去跑步。
然后转过头去就狠狠地咬牙切齿埋怨我，说是我不让他做自己想要做的事。
而我一无所知。
我以为他相信我说的少喝浓茶对身体不好，知道我想让他健康地活着；
我以为他也觉得我爱听的歌好听，每次都有跟我一样的享受；
我以为他也感觉到了跑步带给他身体的舒畅，所以每一次跑步都觉得舒服。
我以为他愿意尝试我相信的，而且在尝试之后也开始相信。我以为在这么久共同相处之后，我们找到了两个人都信仰的东西，找到了两个人都喜欢的东西，我以为我们正慢慢变得越来越一致。
结果，这一个个的和谐背后，在他那里却都藏着怨恨。
每接受一个来自我的东西，他就扔掉一个属于他自己的。他把这笔账算在了我头上。
所以在我越来越觉得和谐的时候，他却对我充满了怨恨。所以我说什么做什么，都一触即发，都轻易激起他的怒火。
Nancy说他并没有隐藏全部的东西，可是天啊，四年，我知道他哪些是真心实意的，哪些是伪装的吗？我怎么判断在哪这事情上承载了他的怨恨？
我难过的是他的隐藏。
可是隐藏背后是什么？
是怨恨，是不甘心，是不真诚。
他为什么要隐藏？为什么不能说出来？
因为他不愿意做坏人，他要我做坏人。他自己只做受害者。
受害者是没错的。
我为什么无法面对他?
因为心里委屈，有怨恨。
现在无法心平气和。
一旦对话，一定会把这些都说出来。
说的时候，一定带着情绪。
到时候，他听到又是另一种感觉。他一定要拼命辩解，又会加深对我的怨恨。
说出来只会让局面变差。
所以，等跟Nancy见过再说吧。
