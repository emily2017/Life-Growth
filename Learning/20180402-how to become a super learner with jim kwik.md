## Technique 2:Morning Routine for peak brain performance
1.Jim's morning routine for a fitter brain:
I believe:first we creats our habits then our habits creats us back.
When I get up in the morning,i'm going to go through some of the first tings that I do every single moning.What's different about my morning is I really focus on how to jump start my most incredible superpower in the world,which is my brain. So everything I do in the morning is to optimize my mind, so I could optimize the day becasuse if you could win the morning, you could win the day.
(1)so the first thing I do when I wake up in the morning is I remember my dreams.The reason is because a lot of people don't realize this but if you're learning all day,your mind doesn't shut off at night.Your subconscious,your unconscious,your non-consciousness is still working on solving those problems,intergrating things,consolidating your short-to long-term memory.
Some of this most remarkable inventions and work of art and science actually came through dreams.
(2)The second things I do when I wake up in the morning is I make up my bed.I do it for two reasons:
1.I believe **how you do anything is how you do everything**.You want to start your day with as win,it's a science of momentum's because **success breads success**.
So take a time make your bed,make it excellent;y and then carry that momentum throughout the day.
2.The other reason why I do it is **how good does it feel when you come home at night,and you come back to a made bed? It's like you come back full circle, back to success.**
(3)The third thing I do, one of the things I do right away is I brush my teeth.**I brush my teeth with the opposite hand**.Because what the latest science is saying is yes, there is a mind-body connection,that your thoughts affects your body.But a lot of people don't know is that your body affects your mind.That using your body in certain ways actually activates parts of your brain.That as your body moves,your brain grooves.
SO for example, brush your teeth with the oposite hand or eating with the opposite hand is actually good for your brain.
(4)Hydrate: Take a whole glass of water
Your body is 70% water,a lot of people feel fatige is because that they're dehydrated.
Most people lose a lot of water when they sleep.
(5)Take a cold shower.
I believe cold therapy is a great way.
We know that if you hit your knee,you put ice on it to reduce the swelling, to reduce the inflammation.and you know top atheletes, they take ice baths.
What is does is it lowers inflammation in your body so cold shower.
And it resets your nervous system,and it's wonderful to have clarity of mind.
Showing puts you into a theta state. A theta is a relaxed state of awareness where you start being very creative.
You notice that when you're in the shower, you come up with all these new ideas.
(6)Make a brain tea
The food you eat either add to your focus or memory or distract.
(7)Journal
Many people have a to-do list,but I also have a not-to-do list.The not-to-do list is larger than the to-do list.
If you're toouching your phone in the first hour of the day,you're doing yourself a disservice because touching your phone and going throgh your phone first hour of a day it does two things:it rewires your brain for two things:
* it trains you for distraction.
* it trains you to be reactive.
**In the first hour of the dau don't touch your phone.It trains you for distraction and being reactive.**
In my journal I want to write three things I call it randomly and professionally.
* What are the three things I need to do to be able to win that day?
(8)Make a brain power smmothie
There're foods that are detract from your fucus:processed food,fried food and so on.But there're certain food that are really good for your bain,like avocado,blueberries(neuropretctive),broccoli,coconut oil,eggs,green leaf vegetables,salmon, sardines,turmeric,walnuts
(9)read
**Leaders are readers.**
One book a week.Because the average person reads about two books a year
(10)Mindfulness Practice
I meditate every single morning for about twenty minutes.**Mindfulness training is very important** because in order to have focus, in order to have clarity of mind and be able to solve problems, you want to go into those brainwave state,we called it alpha wave states.
**Meditation is great for your soul, exercise is great for your body.**
**Whatever is goog for your body is going to be good for your head.**
Exercise in the morning can help you sleep better,manage your weight better
**The No.1 function of the brain is to control our body movements.So as your body moves,your brain grooves.**

**Tip#1:Information + Emotion=Long-term memory**
